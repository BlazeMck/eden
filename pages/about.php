	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>Eden Seed Reserve is a small family-owned business founded by Teri and Kendall Empey. Eden Seed Reserve operates out of the kitchen of their family home, and aims to be accessible to all.</p>
	<p>Eden Seed Reserve was founded for the idea of preparedness. In a world full of uncertainty sometimes the unexpected becomes expected. In the event that food becomes scarce or inaccessible,
	   Eden Seed Reserve intends to make sure you feel prepared in being able to sustain yourself.</p>
	<p>Although the idea is preparedness, that is not the only reason to purchase seeds. We sell seeds to those who are looking to start a home garden either professionally or as a hobby as well.</p>
